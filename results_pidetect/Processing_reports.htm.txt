In the Reports tab, you can generate reports in Relativity to understand the progress and results of processing jobs. You can't run reports on processing sets that have been canceled. When you generate a processing report, this information is recorded in the History tab. 
Note: This topic contains several references to progressive filtration. For context, consider the following explanation: A count based on absolute filtration counts the total number of files each filter eliminates as if it were the only filter applied to the entire data set. A count based on progressive filtration counts the total number of files each filter actually eliminates by accounting for all previously applied filters. For example, a file type filter eliminates 3000 PDF files from a data set, but a previously applied date range filter also eliminated 5000 PDF files. A count based on absolute filtration would report the file type filter as eliminating 8000 PDF files because the count is based on the total number of files each filter  eliminates as if it were the only filter applied to the entire data set. However, a count based on progressive filtration counts the total number of files each filter actually eliminates by accounting for all previously applied filters. In the previous example, a progressive filtration count only reports 3000 PDF files eliminated by the file type filter, because the other 5000 PDF documents were progressively eliminated by the date range filter.

Using processing reports
Imagine you're a litigation support specialist, and someone in your firm needs to see a hard copy of a report that shows them how many files have been discovered in their processing workspace per custodian. They need this report quickly because they're afraid that certain custodians were accidentally associated with the wrong data sources and processing sets.
To produce this, go to the Reports tab under Processing and run the Discovered Files by Custodian report for the processing set(s) that your firm suspects are wrong.



Generating a processing report

Navigate to the Processing tab.
Click the Reports sub-tab. You can also access the Reports tab by clicking the View All Reports link on your processing set console.
From the Select Report section, select the report type you want to generate. When you select a report type, the processing set list to the right is updated to reflect only those sets that are applicable to that report type. For example, if you haven't yet discovered the files in your set, that set won't show up when you select either of the Discovered Files reports. Canceled processing sets aren't available when you're running reports.
From the Select Processing Set section, select the set on which you want to report.
Click Generate Report.
At the top of the report display, there are several icons that control your interaction with the report. For example, you can toggle on and off single or multiple page display, print the page, print the report, export the report, and view the report in full screen mode.


Note: If you export a report that contains Unicode characters as a PDF, and the web server you’re logged in to does not have the font Arial Unicode MS Regular installed (regardless of whether the server the workspace resides on has this font installed), you see blocks in the generated PDF file. To resolve this issue, you can purchase and install the font separately, or you can install Microsoft Office to the web server, which installs the font automatically.

You can generate a new report at any time by clicking New Report at top right of the collapsed report generation window.
Note: If you choose to print a processing report through your browser, that report won't be displayed correctly, in that it will be incomplete. Therefore, it's recommended that you always use Relativity's print button to print reports and not print through the browser.

Breakdown by Error Message 
This table provides a summary of the number of files that received each error and contains the following information:Error Message—the error message.File Count—the number of files that encountered that error. Note: The File Count value will never decrease, even if you resolve errors and retry documents. This is because Relativity gets this value directly from the Errors table in the database, which doesn't communicate error status, only that errors that are present. In other words, even an error that is resolved is still present in the Errors table in the database and therefore will display as being present in the Text Extraction report.Percentage—the percentage of documents that encountered that error.
Note: If you publish processing sets without mapping the File Extension processing field, the Text Extraction report won't accurately report document counts by file type.
