
Known issues
The following list provides descriptions of known issues in  RelativityOne as of 5/10/2024. For a  list of RelativityOne enhancements and resolved issues, please visit the RelativityOne release notes.
Note: Relativity uses a number of third-party technologies to ingest, store, search for, and manipulate data. Relativity does not possess a comprehensive list of all issues ever reported in the third-party technologies, and cannot provide fixes when these application-specific issues arise. Relativity will, however, work to alert the third-party vendor if issues are uncovered.
Note: If your RelativityOne environment has not been upgraded to the latest release, known issues listed as Resolved may not be resolved in your environment yet.

Why we publish known issues
Relativity publishes known issues to provide transparency and to give you the information you need when making upgrade decisions. Relativity Customer Support and Engineering publishes known issues at its own discretion based criteria such as on the number of customer reports, the severity of the issue, and the availability of a workaround. Not all defects are published as known issues. 
When we publish known issues
The known issues list receives updates when the following occurs:

Engineering or Support identifies new known issues.
A monthly update introduces a new known issue.
A monthly update resolves an existing known issue. 

Note:  If you're experiencing an issue in RelativityOne and you don't see it listed on the known issues page, contact Client Services.

REL-909772
Case Strategy
If a user creates a Fact from an Excerpt and navigates to a different version of the document (for example, creating a Fact on the Native and then navigating to Extracted Text), the user may encounter a warning banner that the Excerpt cannot be found. User should confirm that the Fact Excerpt still exists on the document, but otherwise can disregard & close the warning.
No


2023-12-20
REL-893528
RelativityOne Redact

In RelativityOne Redact, we disabled the 'hidden content' toast notification to alert reviewers when Headers or Footers are detected on native spreadsheets because re-opening the file upon navigation would often overwhelm the Viewer's ability to display the document. However, since the Viewer does not display Header/Footer information, our recommendation continues to be that reviewers always check the individual Redact viewer cards for determining coding and/or markup decisions.
Our near-term plan is to add Header/Footer information to the existing Viewer's "hidden content" toast notification.

No


2023-12-19
REL-900455
Case Dynamics

If a Case Dynamics user has permissions on the Excerpt object set to NONE and attempts to open a Fact Layout that contains the Fact Excerpt field, the Fact Excerpt field can look distorted.
 
 * If the Fact Layout is in View mode, the Fact Excerpt field will appear blank.

 * If the Fact Layout is in Edit mode, the Fact Excerpt field will appear very thin; no data will be displayed 

Can be resolved by either granting the user at least VIEW permissions on the Excerpt objects or by selecting a layout without the Fact Excerpts field. 

No

No


2023-11-15
REL-891499
Case Dynamics
If a Fact Excerpt contains too many characters in a row without a space, the Excerpt Pill may distort and hide the (x) Icon to delete the Fact Excerpt from the Fact. To avoid this scenario, we recommend creating Fact Excerpts from text that contains spaces and/or limiting the length of a Fact Excerpt without spaces to approximately 40 characters. User can also create multiple excerpts to append to a Fact if more text is needed. If a Fact Excerpt is created where the pill (x) icon is hidden, please delete the Fact and recreate from a new, shorter Excerpt.
No


2023-11-09
REL-890960

No


2023-10-30
REL-887507
Import Export
Import/Export maps KWX profile files differently than RDC. 

When using RDC, more fields are mapped than by the Import/Export application.It may be a problem for users that not all fields from the KWX profile files are applied when using the Import/Export application. As a result, they may export data with less information than expected. To avoid that, a user may map missing fields manually on the Import/Export UI when configuring the job.Another workaround would be using new Import/Export profiles (.ie file) that can be exported from the application.
Yes

There are below known issues with post publish delete mass operations functionality for GOV tenants. The issue will be resolved once GOV tenants move to processing dynamic workers.
						
* On post publish delete for GOV tenants on Relativity, the files will be deleted from Relativity, but corresponding files will not be deleted from Invariant system causing the two systems to be out of sync.
						
* Post-publish deduplication will not run and new duplicate masters of the deleted file will not be published. 

						* A publish/republish of any duplicate document of the deleted files will error out since they won't have a file to overlay the data on in Relativity.

No


2023-08-22
REL-714910
Publish
Dedupe fields are not getting populated on primary documents unless all five dedupe fields (All Custodians, Dedupe Custodians, All Paths, Dedupe Paths, Dedupe Count) are mapped.  To work around the issue, map all five fields and republish the documents. This will populate the dedupe fields.
No


2023-08-04

Yes


2023-07-25
REL-851430
RelativityOne Redact
In RelativityOne Redact, the underlying OCR engine that Image Projects utilize is unable to identify project rule search hits when the term, phrase, or pattern is surrounded by an equal number of dashes. For example, a project rule for the term 'Agent' would not return search hits for the text '--- Agent ---'. Relativity OCR, however, is not encumbered by this scenario. Therefore, the suggested workflow is to QC search term hits on the text generated by Relativity OCR and to manually draw redactions wherever there is a discrepancy.
No


2023-07-21
REL-862203
Review Center
You cannot set the Workspace Admin group as a Reviewer Group in a Review Center queue.

REL-825005
Field Mapping
On Relativity GOV instances, when a user attempts to create a new field in a workspace and selects a field in the source property, the field is created but the source is not mapped and is empty. This issue will be addressed when GOV tenants are updated to dynamic workers. As a workaround for now, we have scripts that GOV tenants can use to map fields. Please reach out to Relativity support to run these scripts.
No


2023-04-19
REL-783839

Assisted Review
					
If you restore a workspace which contains a classification index referencing a trained model and restore that workspace in a different instance, the classification index builds without error in the restored workspace. However, the contents of the model are not carried over in the restore so your new Active Learning project will not learn from that trained model. The intended behavior is to receive an error when rebuilding the classification index in the restored workspace, as you cannot ARM trained models across instances.

Still update path method, does the path update (and file name update) in case of linked files always to file guid name. (thats why if original linked file was not guid named, it will be moved and renamed).Renaming linked files in case of changing them to repository files which mean copy them into repository is desired behavior because e.g. there can be already a file in repository with exactly same name, and the it would be overwritten or skipped, or cause error)

There is a known issue where Elusion Tests will not complete in a timely fashion due to one (or more) documents being assigned to a reviewer who is no longer active in the review.

Freeing a document allows it to be reviewed by another reviewer.
						
It takes one hour post the user logging out of Relativity for the document to be unassigned. This impacts the elusion test if the user leaves the viewer without saving the document, the elusion test document won't be available for another user until one hour after the user logs out of Relativity.

						When a user upgrades Case Dynamics to a Foxglove or above version, they will not see the people that were linked in the Offline Report prior to the upgrade. This issue stems from a problem with our migration code where people listed in the Person object are converted into Key People (on the Entity object) and must be relinked using the Key People (Entities) field on the Report Set object. This second step is not taking place. 

						There is a workaround for users where they can find the people (now Key People) that were not re-linked to the Offline Report(s) during the migration. The user can create a custom view on the Report Set object where the, Name, Report Set People and Key Entities fields are listed. Once the view is created, the user can go to the Report Set tab, open the new view and see the Key Entities that need to be relinked to the Report. Once the user finds the people that need to be relinked, they can go into the Offline Reports and manually link the Key People (and regenerate the report) or use the RDC to do an overlay

In Goatsbeard 3/Indigo 1 there are revised interactions implemented for the Dial and the Circle Pack Cluster Visualization options:
						
* Select and Apply Filter: Single click (_left click_)
						
*  Zooming/drilling into and out of a cluster: Double Click (_left click_)
For the Dial, the expectation after double clicking zooming into a cluster is that to zoom back out, you can either double click in the center of the cluster or double click the white space around the cluster (Dial or Circle Pack). The known issue in Goatsbeard 3/Indigo 1 is if you click or double click on the center of the cluster (Dial), filtering behavior is the action instead of zooming back out to the previous cluster view. The work around for zooming out for Dial and Circle pack is to click on the white space around the cluster to zoom back out, which is already an available option.

Relativity Scripts & Utilities
Due to the limitations of the Relativity script framework, we recommend running the Populate Parent ID to Child ID script on productions with a maximum of 20,000-30,000 documents.
