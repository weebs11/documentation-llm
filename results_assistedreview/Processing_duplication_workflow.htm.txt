Components 
This custom solution consists of the following components:

Relativity application 
Relativity scripts that run at the workspace level within a script group

Considerations 

This script should only be run by a system admin. If you are not a system admin, we recommend you do not run this script.
The solution may require you to create fields in your environment. The All Source Locations and All Custodians scripts require a new field to store the output of running those scripts.Please see Update Duplicate Status script for detailed information about corresponding fields that need to be created.
You have the option of tagging a document as Responsive and then propagating that value to the document’s family members. For more information, see Applying propagation to documents.

Deploying and configuring the solution

Running the solution
After you install and configure the solution to a workspace, the Processing Item Level Scripts and Processing Family Scripts sub-tabs become available under the Processing Duplication Workflow tab and contain three Relativity scripts within a script group:

All Custodians script (Item Level)
All Source Locations script (Item Level)
Update Duplicate Status script (Item Level)
All Custodians script (Family Level)
All Source Locations script (Family Level)
Update Duplicate Status script (Family Level)

When choosing which script to run, keep in mind the group of documents you wish to run your script on. For example, to find which families of documents are duplicates, execute the Update Duplicate Status script (Family Level) script. To find any duplicate in your dataset regardless of family, execute the All Custodians script (Item Level).
All Custodians (Item Level) script
The All Custodians (Item Level) script populates a field with the names of all custodians who own a document. To run the All Custodians (Item Level) script: 

Navigate to the Processing Item Level Scripts sub-tab. 
The Processing Item Level Scripts page appears. Select the radio button next to All Custodians (Item Level). 
Complete the following fields: Saved Search—Required. Select the saved search which will contain the group of documents the script will be executed against. This should include all files you wish to run the script against regardless of family relationships. This is because the script will run on each document independently of one another.Duplicate Hash Field—Required. Select the relational field which defines groups of duplicate documents. For example, MD5, SHA1, or Processing Duplication Hash.Custodian—Required. Select the Custodian object that contains your custodian information.Custodian Field—Required. Select the field that contains the custodian name.Destination (output)—Required. Select the long text field to store the semi-colon delimited list of custodians.Batch Size—this field is optional and is the number of files in a saved search batch. Leave this field blank to use the default value of 50,000 or enter a value below 50,000 to increase the script execution speed.
Click Run. 

All Source Locations (Item Level) script
The All Source Locations (Item Level) script identifies all source locations for a duplicate document. To run the All Source Locations (Item Level) script:

Navigate to the Processing scripts (Item Level) sub-tab. 
The Processing Item Level Scripts page appears. Select the radio button next to All Source Locations (Item Level).
Complete the following fields: Saved Search—Required. Select the saved search which will contain the group of documents the script will be executed against. This should include all files you wish to run the script against regardless of family relationships. This is because the script will run on each document independently of one another.Duplicate Hash Field—Required. Select the relational field which defines groups of duplicate documents. For example, MD5, SHA1, or Processing Duplication Hash.Source Field—Required. Select the long text field that contains the source location for documents.Destination Field (output)—Required. Select the long text field to store the semi-colon delimited list of source locations.Batch Size—this field is optional and is the number of files in a saved search batch. Leave this field blank to use the default value of 50,000 or enter a value below 50,000 to increase the script execution speed.
Click Run. 

Update Duplicate Status (Item Level) script
Before running the Update Duplicate Status (Item Level) script, you need to create fields in your environment by doing the following:

Navigate to the workspace in which you are running the solution
Create a new single choice field on the Document object with three choices (names must be exact, but are not case-sensitive): Unique, Master, or Duplicate.
(Optional) Make sure a whole number field is created for the Entity object if utilizing the order of the custodians associated with the documents.
Make sure each custodian has a unique order number. Do not use numbers less than 1.
Verify that a Custodian single-object field exists on the Document object. Create a Custodian field if one does not already exist. 
Set up a saved search that returns the group of documents the script will be executed against. This should include all files you wish to run the script against regardless of family relationships. This is because the script will run on each document independently of one another. The duplicate status field is set on all documents included in the search.

To run the Update Duplicate Status script:

Navigate to the Processing Item Level Scripts sub-tab. 
The Processing Item Level Script page appears. Select the radio button next to Update Duplicate Status (Item Level).
Complete the following fields: Saved Search—use the saved search described above.Duplicate Status Field—use the duplicate status field created above.Duplicate Hash—select a file duplicate hash field. If using Relativity Processing to load data, the Processing duplicate hash field can be used.Duplicate Sort Order—this is a field located on the Entity object. Leave this blank unless you have set up a field on the Entity object to maintain a custom priority sort order by custodian. When this field is blank, the system sorts on document artifact ID from the Document object, so the first document loaded in the workspace becomes the Primary document when duplicates are identified. See Viewing the Results for more information on how this field operates.Batch Size—this field is optional and is the number of files in a saved search batch. Leave this field blank to use the default value of 50,000 or enter a value below 50,000 to increase the script execution speed.

All Custodians (Family) script
The All Custodians (Family) script populates a field with the names of all custodians who own a document. To run the All Custodians (Family) script:

Navigate to the Processing Family Scripts sub-tab. 
The Processing Family Scripts page appears. Select the radio button next to All Custodians (Family).
Complete the following fields: Saved Search—Required. Select the saved search which contains the group of documents the script  executes against. This should include all parent level documents, and their families. This is because the script will propagate the tagging from parents to the children level.Duplicate Hash Field—Required. Select the relational field which defines groups of duplicate documents. For example, MD5, SHA1, or Processing Duplication Hash.Custodian Object—Required. Select the Custodian object that contains your custodian information.Family Identifier—Required. Select the relational field which defines groups of family documents.Level Field—Required. Select the whole number field which defines a numeric value indicating how deeply nested the document is within the family. This is commonly called Level if the data was discovered and published through Relativity Processing.Custodian Object Field—Required. Select the field that contains the custodian name.Destination Field (output)—Required. Select the long text field to store the semi-colon delimited list of source locations.Batch Size—this field is optional and is the number of files in a saved search batch. Leave this field blank to use the default value of 50,000 or enter a value below 50,000 to increase the script execution speed.
Click Run.
