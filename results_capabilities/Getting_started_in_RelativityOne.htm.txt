RelativityOne downtime windows
The advantage to RelativityOne is that we maintain and upgrade your software to ensure that your business operations in RelativityOne run smoothly and that you always have access to the latest features and defect fixes. We require regular downtime windows to do this, typically during non-business hours. 
Please refer to RelativityOne maintenance downtime windows for more information on this schedule.
RelativityOne repository workspace
When installed to an existing workspace, the RelativityOne repository workspace application converts the workspace into a more streamlined version for performing early case assessment (ECA) on processed data. This limited workspace is equipped with  Relativity functionality you need for early case assessment  while providing more cost-effective pricing for storing data that may not be actively used in a case.
Note: You cannot use a repository workspace for review or production purposes.
See RelativityOne repository workspace.
