
Custom connectors
You can integrate into the Contracts  Analysis pipeline through custom connectors.  A custom connector is a framework that customers can use to wrap around their existing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines, applications, or third-party services, allowing seamless integration to the Contracts  Analysis pipeline.  

You can use custom connectors to integrate an internal entity extraction application without having to manually export/import data from Relativity, connect to a third-party contract analytics tool you are currently using, and more.


Contracts  custom connectors support the following functionality:



Document classification

Segmentation

Annotations

Field Population

Configuring a custom connector 
To configure a custom connector:


                Create a New Contracts  Model.
            

                For Model Type select External Analysis.
            

                Enter your API's endpoint URL for External API Endpoint.
            

                Click Check to verify connection.
                Note: This verification is performed from your Relativity web server. Depending on your Relativity infrastructure setup, connectivity may be different from your agent servers compared to your web servers.  Check with your Relativity IT administrator if you experience problems.


                    Use the @ character to trigger a list of Relativity fields to select and map to a JSON property.
                

                    To send the document’s native file, use the Contracts  Native field.  This provides a base64 encoded version of the Relativity document in the request body.
                

Click Edit Body to enter your API's JSON request body.Use the @ character to trigger a list of Relativity fields to select and map to a JSON property.To send the document’s native file, use the Contracts  Native field.  This provides a base64 encoded version of the Relativity document in the request body.

                Click Save once all mapping is complete.
                Note: Validation will occur to verify the input API Body is valid JSON. If not, a message will appear. 
Select a Relativity Object to populate from your API’s response.

Field mapping is done after saving the Model first and then going back to edit it.
Token mapping
To set up token mapping:


                After saving the model, you'll see three new sections appear:  
                
                            Object Mapping
                        
                            Document Mapping
                        
                            Authentication Headers.
                        

                Click the Edit button on the Object Mapping card to view a mapping interface  with the Relativity Object Fields on the left and Response Properties on the right.
            

                Select the Relativity object fields from the list on the left.
            

                Click the Paste Response button on the right, then paste in a sample response from your API.
            

                Click the Generate Properties button at the bottom.  Contracts's custom connector framework will parse the sample, extract the properties and display them to map to the Relativity object fields.
                Note: If your sample response does not contain all properties you can use the Add Tokens field at the top of the list to add any additional tokens needed for mapping.

                Once you have all fields mapped, click Save.
            

                The page will refresh and display the new token mappings at the bottom.
            

                For Authentication Headers, click New and add a Parameter Name, Parameter Value, and Parameter Location, header or URL.
            

                When the request is sent, we will append the headers so that each request or document includes the headers, allowing you to send custom headers for each request to support authentication requirements of third party services.
            

Custom connector developer documentation
This section provides an overview of custom connectors for developers.
Authentication
Custom Connectors support the use of one of the following standard authentication methods: API Key.
Request
We provide you with a simple configuration interface to map Relativity Fields to the properties in your API's request schema.
Requirements

All HTTP requests will be sent using the POST method.
HTTP version 1.1 is required. 2.0 is currently not supported.
Requests may be sent using HTTP or HTTPS. However, HTTPS is recommended.

Examples
Below are multiple example of API calls.
Extracted text example
In the following example, let’s say your API requires two fields to be sent for a request:





Name
Description


id
The document ID


text
The extracted text of the document



An example JSON request body would look like the following:

Examples
Following are examples of API calls.
Annotation, segmentation, and classification
The following are example responses your API would return to support the use cases of annotations, segmentation, and classification.
Annotations
This example will save an Organization annotation on document 12345 with the text of “Acme & Sons Bank”. This annotation will be visible to users when viewing the document with the Contracts Viewer.



Segmentation
This example will create two sections on document 12345. These sections will be visible to users when viewing the document with the Contracts  Viewer.



Classification
This example will classify document 12345 as a Loan Agreement and save that classification to the Contract Type Relativity field.



Relativity field population
The following is an example response your API would return to support the Relativity Field Population use case.
This example identifies in document 12345 the fields Invoice ID and Invoice Amount which can be setup to map to a Relativity Object when running Contracts  Analysis.
