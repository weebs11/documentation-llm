
Privilege results
Upon the successful completion of the Populate Privilege Results step, the results will not immediately begin to populate in the workspace. There may be a delay of a few days between the completion of this step and when results begin to incrementally populate the workspace. The time taken for results to populate depends on the size of the dataset being analyzed. To check if the results have been populated, run a search that looks at Priv::Prediction is SET and Priv Project=[the name of the project you are running].
Some results are populated to fields directly on the Document object, while others are populated to aiR for Privilege Document Results Object fields and then reflected onto the Document object through the multiple object Priv field. See all fields that are name spaced with "Priv::".
Results will never be overwritten or updated after the completion of Populate Privilege Results.
