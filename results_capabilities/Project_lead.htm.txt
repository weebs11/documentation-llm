This section describes common tasks and interfaces used by Project Leads when working with PI Detect. Project leads work hands-on with the client to obtain a final work product that meets all their needs. PI Detect projects are largely customizable and require regular communication between a project lead and the client through e-mail, phone, and video calls. Project leads also work behind the scenes to organize batches of documents for reviewers, generate reports, and make sure quality control measures are in place.
Project leads have access to the following capabilities in PI Detect:
