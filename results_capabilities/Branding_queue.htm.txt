Branding queue

The Branding Queue displays production jobs receiving branding of redactions, header, footer, or other modifications. A production job displays in this queue only while it has a status of branding. The production job remains in the production queue until all branding is complete.
You can view the branding queue from Home. Select the Queue Management tab, and then click Branding Queue. See Branding queue fields for details.
Note: Branding agents scale automatically in RelativityOne. 
To change the priority of a job, click the Change Priority button at the bottom of the view. Enter a new integer value in the Priority field, and then click Update. Only one job  runs at a time, the lower numbered job runs first and the higher numbered job runs last.
Note:  Any change to the priority of a job in the branding queue also changes its priority in the production queue.
