Pivot
Using Pivot, you can quickly analyze your workspace data to identify trends or patterns. You can use Pivot to summarize data in tables or charts, simplifying the analysis process. You can also create ad hoc Pivot reports using the options available on the Pivot menu. 
To generate a Pivot report, you specify a field for grouping data totals and further characterize this data by selecting a secondary field. The Pivot grid displays your results in a table format that you can customize for more convenient viewing. See  Running Pivot reports.
System admins or users with the appropriate permissions can create custom Pivot profiles that you can reuse on multiple data sets. You can configure these profiles with field information and formatting for charts, including line, pie, and bar graphs. 
Note: Relativity doesÂ not support Pivot On or Group By for Long Text fields due to the performance impact. However, you can create a Pivot on any Relativity field that is enabled for Group By or Pivot On even if that field doesn't appear in the current view.
