Translate
With Translate, you can select a set of documents that are in different languages and translate them to another language so that they can be searched and reviewed. You can also translate a single document from the Viewer. For dozens of file types, including Microsoft Office files and PDFs, you can receive a translation in the native format of the document, along with the translated extracted text. After successfully starting a Translate job, you will receive an email notifying you when it has completed along with a link to the translated documents. 
Each document that is successfully translated is charged to you individually. Each errored document will not incur any charge to you. Translated documents can then be seen in either the native format or the translated language in the Translation Viewer.
Translate requirements


Translate is a separate application that must be installed into your instance, and desired workspaces. For more information, see Installing the Translate application.


You must have an enabled RelativityOne license to use Translate. 


Translate is not available for certain file types. 


Relativity can revoke or limit access to Translate if it is used in an unauthorized manner. Translate cannot be used by customers or third parties to, directly or indirectly, create, train, or improve a similar or competing product or service.


Installing the Translate application
Note: Translate is compatible with client domains. You can limit access by installing the Translate application in workspaces with client domains. You can also configure permission levels per workspace based on end-user needs.
Once the Translate application has been installed in your instance, you can install it to any workspace you would like. 
Note: The Relativity Translated Extracted Text field is created as part of the installation process. If you already have a field with this name created, you will receive an error when trying to install the Translate application. We recommend either editing or deleting the Relativity Translated Extracted Text field and then installing the application.

Fields
The following fields can display in the Translate documents modal:

Translate To—select the language you wish to translate the current document to.Note: Translate automatically detects the language of the current document. Hidden content, such as notes, comments, or hidden cells, are translated as well. Attachments and embedded documents are not translated by this application, however.

Translation Source—select the document source for this translation:

Native—if selected, the original document file will be used for the translation. When this option is selected, the If Native unsupported, translate Text field displays in the modal.Note: Certain file types can be translated in their original format. A full list of file types, encodings, and other limitations can be found in the modal by clicking on Additional file limits may apply.

Text—if selected, the extracted text will be used for the translation. The Source text field option displays in the modal.
If Native unsupported, translate Text—enable this option to automatically translate the extracted text from the selected Source text field if the native document’s format cannot be translated. We recommend enabling this option. If enabled, the Source text field displays in the modal.


Source text field—select the long text field you would like to translate. Any long text field that has the Available in the Viewer option enabled will appear in this drop-down menu. This option only displays if either Text is selected or If Native unsupported, translate Text is enabled.


Translate job estimate—click on this link in the modal to view an estimate of the total number of documents that will be translated with this job. Each document unit that is successfully translated will incur a charge. The estimate is based on the selected Source text field.
Note: This is an estimate and does not account for numbers, which are non-translatable characters. It also does not account for additional content that Translate finds during the translation process that wasn’t recognized by Relativity’s OCR or text extraction tools.





Additional file limits may apply—click on this link in the modal to view Translate's file limitations, including document type and file size limits.




Populated fields
The following fields are populated for documents once a Translate job has finished:


Relativity Translated Extracted Text—this field is populated with all of the translated extracted text, even if a document is translated multiple times to multiple languages.


Translation Document Source—this field is populated on the original document, and is named with the control number and target language. This is a multi-object field that can be used to identify which documents have been successfully translated and to what languages.


Working with translated documents
Documents that have been translated function differently than other documents in Relativity. When a document is translated, a Translation RDO is created to store the translated document which is then linked back to the original document to ensure it is preserved. The Translation RDO does not receive a control number and is not stored as a separate document.
Redact is not compatible with translated native documents. 
Once a document is translated, the Relativity Translated Extracted Text field is created. This long text field is populated with the translated extracted text and can be used in various types of searches. You can also use the Relativity Translated Extracted Text field to build out analytics indexes.
Re-translating documents
If you need to re-translate one or more documents into the same language, do the following:


Navigate to the Translated Documents tab.


Filter the list as needed to locate the documents you wish to re-translate.


Select the desired documents from the list.


Select Delete from the mass operations drop-down menu.The Delete X Translated Documents modal displays.


Click Delete.The previous translation is removed and the document is ready to be re-translated.


Mass exporting translated documents
We recommend mass exporting translated documents using Import/Export with the RDO export option. The following options are unique to exporting translated documents:


Ensure that Translated Documents is selected for the Relativity Object Type field.


Optionally, consider creating or editing a view so that it contains only the translated documents you wish to export. This view can then be selected for the View field in the Import/Export modal to determine which documents are exported.


To learn more about this export workflow, see RDO file export.
Viewing a job's status and usage
You can see the details of a Translate job, including whether it was successful and when it finished from the Translate Jobs tab. Each document that is included in a job is listed separately on this tab. Additionally, you can see information on the usage of Translate in columns like Doc Units to better understand how you will be charged.
The Translate tab is automatically filtered to display jobs that are pending and were created in the last week. You can edit or remove these filters as desired.
The Translate Jobs tab is available at both the instance-level and workspace-level. The information that displays is determined by workspace permissions and lockbox settings.
Optionally, click the Export to CSV icon to download a .csv file that contains the information on the Translate Jobs tab.
The columns on the Translate Jobs tab are described below:

Troubleshooting Translate jobs
If you start a Translate job and do not see a notification that it started successfully, you will see one of the following messages instead. Information on how to troubleshoot these scenarios is also provided below.





Notification
Troubleshooting Tips




Translation Job failed.
For assistance with resolving this notification, contact ﻿Relativity Support..


Translation job started, but with the below file warnings.

This message displays if the job starts but Translate identifies potential native documents that will not be translated because the file type is not supported or the document file size is over 40 MB. 
If the document file size is too big, try translating the extracted text instead. 
Translate uses the Relativity Native Type field (and its associated File ID) to determine the file type. If that field is Unknown format type, the original document cannot be translated.
You can click on the Save X untranslated documents as a Saved Search link to access the files which will not be translated.
Note: If documents are in a secured folder and fail to be translated, ensure that the user trying to translate them has the Translate Documents permission on that folder. Otherwise, the user will see an "Insufficient Permission" message.




Once a Translate job finishes, you may see the any of the following messages in the email that is automatically sent to you. 


ServiceUnavailable: The document or part of its content is unsupported.


Document cannot be opened due to possibly being corrupt.


Document failed during checking validity. This may be caused by corruption or unsupported type/extension.


Job has timed out.


If you receive any of these notifications, we recommend deleting the Translation Relativity Dynamic Object (RDO) and trying to translate the native document again. If this does not resolve the issue, try translating the extracted text of the affected documents instead. If you are still receiving this email notification after trying both of these potential solutions, contact ﻿Relativity Support.
