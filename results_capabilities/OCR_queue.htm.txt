Your permission settings determine whether or not you have access to the OCR Queue tab from Home. You can view all submitted OCR jobs in the environment to check their status, priority, and the workspace to which they belong. You can only access the OCR Queue tab from Home.
To display the default OCR Queue view, select the Queue Management tab, and then click OCR Queue. This list displays all OCR jobs submitted by users in your instance that haven't yet successfully completed.
