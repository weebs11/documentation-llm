Build a checked-out documents view

You can build views for a reviewer to see only their checked-out documents that either have not been reviewed yet or have already been reviewed. We recommend creating or designating a field for coding documents before completing these steps.

Navigate to the Views tab.
Click New View.
Complete the required fields. See Views for more information.
Click Conditions.
Click the + Condition button.
On the Add Condition - Select Field modal, select Batch from the list.
Click the arrow next to the Batch button and select Batch::Assigned To from the list.
Click on the operators drop-down menu and select is logged in user.
Click Apply.
Click the arrow next to the Batch button and select Batch::Status from the list.
Click on the operators drop-down menu and select any of these.
Select the In Progress option from the list and click the Move selected from left to right icon.
Click Apply.
Click the + Condition button.
On the Add Condition - Select Field modal, select the field you use for coding decisions from the list. 
Select is not set from the operators drop-down menu to create a view of unreviewed documents or select is set from the operators drop-down menu for a view of reviewed documents.
Click Apply.
Click Save.
Optionally, repeat these steps and choose the alternate option for step 16 to create both an unreviewed and reviewed view for checked-out documents.
