
Filters
Filtering provides a fast and easy way to search for items in a list in Relativity. You can use filters to search for values in the fields on the active view, and across all records available in the searchable set. Filters are also available for item lists  on tabs and pop-up windows.
The field type associated with each column determines the available filter types, such as text boxes, pop-up pickers, and drop-down lists. You do not need any specific security permissions to use filtering.

Using filters

You’re a Relativity admin facilitating a review project on a huge set of documents that includes thousands of emails between traders and investors in your client’s products. You need to quickly find all documents owned by trader Johnny Arnold that are related to gas and power, because the evidence they might contain may not be admissible in court. To do this, you turn to filters.
You find the view you set up for documents already coded for key issues and you click the filter icon. In the Custodian field you enter the last name of the employee in question, "Arnold." In the Key Issue field you select the Gas and Power choices.


This simple filtering job returns a small set of documents on which you do a quick review and find that they contain references that make them inadmissible. 



Showing and hiding filters in the item list
You can use filters to quickly narrow your searchable set, allowing you to browse through the key documents in the viewer efficiently.
The following filter buttons display above item lists in Relativity:

Show/Hide filters ()—displays the field column filters for an item list at the top of each column. This icon turns orange when you activate a filter. Click the icon again to hide the filter. Your filter settings remain unchanged. 
Clear all ()—removes the current filter settings. This option is only available after you set a filter.

The filter type determines the steps required to set the search criteria that it uses. See Filter types.
Note: When you create or edit a field, you can select its Filter Type. See Fields.
 In the following example, the active filters display on the Documents tab.



Setting a filter
To activate the filter options  at the top of each column in the item list, click the Show filter () icon. The icon turns orange when you activate a filter. Click the icon again to hide the filter.
Note: Before defining a new search filter, click the Clear All () icon or the Clear All Conditions link in the search panel to remove any previous settings. For example, say you create a filter on the Privileged field, but now want to search only by the Custodian field. If you don't clear the filter, Relativity filters your documents by both the Privileged and Custodian fields, and your result set may include fewer documents than you expect.
Select a field or fields that you want to filter (such as Record Type.) The filter type determines the steps required to set the search criteria that it uses. See Filter types.
Make your selections from  the filter drop-down menu or enter text in the filter text box (if the field is a text field), and then click Enter.
The field column header displays the filter icon to let you know filtering is on for that field. This persists whether or not you have the filters shown or hidden.



The search panel is also updated with the applied filter conditions and displayed as a filter card in a List Conditions box. 



You cannot edit the filter card by clicking on it. However, you can clear the list condition the same way you can clear any search conditions on the search panel. The item list updates accordingly. 
See Filter types and Text box filter search examples for more information on using specific filters.
Filter types
Relativity includes the following filter types:

Boolean filters
Numeric filters
List filters
Date filters
Multi-list filters
Text box filters

Using Boolean filters
Boolean filters are available only on Yes/No field types. To use a Boolean filter, click the drop-down menu arrow and select True, False, or <blank> from the list to apply the filter.
In the following example, selecting True displays only documents that have native files (where the field has a Yes value). If selected, <blank> displays only items that do not have the a True (Yes) or False (No) value assigned to the Boolean field (is not set).



If you click on Advanced, the pop-up for the Boolean filter appears where you can specify multiple filter conditions that are connected with explicit OR operators. Click Apply to apply the specified filter conditions to the field.



Click Add Condition to add an additional condition to the filter.
Using numeric filters for numbers
The numeric filter type is available for the following field types only:

Decimal 
Whole Number
Currency

To use a numeric filter, click the drop-down menu arrow and select  an operator (such as equal to (=), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), less than or equal to (<=), or greater than or equal to (>=)), and then enter a numerical value in the Filter text box. 
Note: Relativity will also correctly read the thousands separator (such as 100,000.00) in numeric filters.
After you enter the value in the tex tbox, click Enter to apply the conditional expression for filtering the list (such as filter the list for File Size greater than a certain number). 



If you click into the Filter text box, a drop-down menu appears. You can select the Advanced option that appears in the drop-down menu to display the pop-up for the numeric filter. This is where you can specify multiple filter conditions that are connected with explicit OR operators. Click Apply to apply the specified filter conditions to the field.



Click Add Condition to add an additional condition to the filter.
Using List filters
The List filter type is available for the following field types only:

Single Choice
Single Object 
User
Fixed Length Text
Fields that contain a large number of items may also cause the List filter to take longer to populate. For fields that may contain a large number of choices, you can designate a pop-up filter instead. 
Fixed Length Text fields—if the field contains more than 255 items, the List filter type you specify for the field reverts to the Text box filter type and an error is written to the Error Log when you visit a Document list view containing the field. 
Single Choice/Single Object fields—if the field contains more than 255 items, the List filter type you specify for the field reverts to None (disabled) and an error is written to the Error Log when you visit a Document list view containing the field. 

List filters are frequently associated with fields used for coding documents. The conditions displayed in the drop-down menu for this filter vary by the type and purpose of the associated field. For example, a field called Responsiveness might have the filter conditions of Responsive, Not Responsive, or Needs Further Review. You can select the checkboxes of the options that you want to filter for, and then click Apply to apply the filter to the item list. Alternatively, you can click Select all to select all filters in the list, you can click Clear to remove all selections in the menu or you can select (Not Set) to only show items where the field has not been set (null). 
If there is a single choice that you would like to immediately apply as a filter to the document list, hover your cursor over that choice's row and then click Only on the right side of the row.
In this example, if you only select the Non-Responsive checkbox, then only documents coded with this value display in the item list. 
Note: You can find a specific option in a long list by entering all or part of the name of the option you are looking for in the Filter box under the Apply  button. The list filters automatically as you type.



Click the Advanced filters () icon in the upper-right corner of the drop-down menu to launch a pop-up where you can select items in the list and use additional operators such as filtering for items that do NOT contain certain field values. Click Apply to apply the specified filter conditions to the field.


Using date filters
The date filter type is only available for Date field types.  Using the date filter, you can quickly and efficiently filter for items meeting the specific date criteria that you want.
The following operators are available:

All
Not Set
Is
Is before
Is before or on
Is after
Is after or on
Between 

For example, you only want to view items that were sent before or on 7 AM on January 21, 2015. To set and apply a date filter for this scenario:

Select your operator from the drop-down list underneath the Apply button (such as is before or on). 
Use the calendar interface to select the date criteria (such as January 21, 2015). There are drop-down menus for selecting a specific month and year or you can use the forward and backward arrows to navigate by month.
Enter the time below the calendar (such as 7:00 AM).
Note: Filtering on fields using the date/time format does not support using “@Today”. If you do not enter a specific time, a time of 12:00 AM is entered explicitly for the filter.



Click Apply to apply the date filter. Only items that were sent before 7 AM on January 21, 2015 display in your item list.

Note: When you select the Between operator, two calendars display in the drop-down date filter, allowing you to pick the start and end date/time for the time range.
You can click the Advanced option in the drop-down date filter to launch a pop-up to take advantage of additional operators such as "is in" that let you filter for items where the date is in this week, last week, last month, or this month and create more complex date filter criteria using multiple conditions. Click Apply to apply the specified filter conditions to the field.



Using multi-list filters
The multi-list filter type is available for the following field types only:

Multiple Choice
Multiple Object 
Single Choice

Using multi-list filters, you can select multiple conditions from a drop-down menu. These filters are frequently associated with fields used for coding documents.
To apply a multi-list filter, click the drop-down arrow to display the conditions list. Select the conditions that you want to filter on. You can click Select all to select all filters in the list, you can click Clear to remove all selections in the menu or you can select (Not Set) to only show items where the field is been set (null). Click Apply to apply the selected filter conditions.
If there is a single choice that you would like to immediately apply as a filter to the document list, hover your cursor over that choice's row and then click Only on the right side of the row.



Note: You can find an specific option in a long list by entering all or part of the name of the option you are looking for in the Filter text box under the Apply  button. The list filters automatically as you type.



Click the Advanced filters () icon in the upper-right corner of the drop-down menu to launch a pop-up where you can select items in the list and use additional operators such as filtering for items that do NOT contain certain field values. Click Apply to apply the specified filter conditions to the field.


Using text box filters
The text box filter type is available for the following field types only:

Fixed-length Text
Long Text
Date
Whole Number
Decimal
Currency
Object

You can use text box filters to search on specific terms, numbers, and dates. You can directly enter one or more terms in the filter text box and connect multiple terms with any of the following operators:

AND
OR
IS SET
IS NOT SET
BETWEEN
= (equal)
>= (greater than or equal to)
<= (less than or equal to)

When entering terms and operators directly in a text box filter, you must use the proper syntax. See Text box filter search examples for more information.
Note: The text box filter treats each search term as if it were preceded and followed by a wildcard (*) and returns all versions of the term. Do not add an asterisk (*) to the beginning or ending of a search term. The filter will not return any results if you use this operator.
You can also use the advanced text box filter feature to build more advanced filter queries on the selected text field. See Using advanced text box filtering.
Text box filter search examples
You can perform text searches using Boolean operators by directly entering search strings in the filter text box as follows or you can use the Advanced feature to build more advanced filter queries on the text field (see Using advanced text box filtering).
Boolean and other search operators
The following table lists examples of valid search strings using Boolean and other operators.





Valid search strings
Returns items where…




cubs OR sox
([FIELD VALUE] like '*cubs*') OR ([FIELD VALUE] like '*sox*')


cubs AND sox
([FIELD VALUE] like '*cubs*') AND ([FIELD VALUE] like '*sox*')


cubs OR sox AND kcura
([FIELD VALUE] like '*cubs*') OR (([FIELD VALUE] like '*sox*') AND ([FIELD VALUE] like '*kcura*'))


percent sign ( % )
Use this operator to check whether the field is set to a value. It behaves like the "Is like" operator in a query.


underscore ( _ )
Wildcard for a missing character. Do not use the underscore to check if a field is set to a value; it is slower and more resource-intensive than using the percent sign (%).


= with term
Returns an exact phrase.


cubs sox
Returns the exact phrase (that is, the word "cubs" followed by a space and the word "sox").


IS SET
Returns only items where the field has a value.


IS NOT SET
Returns only items where the field does not have a value (null).



The following table shows examples of invalid search strings.





Invalid search strings
Description




cubs AND
The AND operator requires a right search term.


cubs OR
The OR operator requires a right search term.


AND cubs
The AND operator requires a left search term.


OR cubs
The OR operator requires a left search term.



Alphabetical filtering
The following table lists examples of valid search strings you can use to filter text alphabetically.





Alphabetical 
						filtering
					
Returns items where…




>= cubs
[FIELD VALUE] >= 'cubs'


<= cubs
[FIELD VALUE] <= 'cubs'


= cubs
[FIELD VALUE] = 'cubs'


= cubs AND sox
[FIELD VALUE] = 'cubs AND sox'


cubs BETWEEN sox * 
([FIELD VALUE] >= 'cubs') AND ([FIELD VALUE] <= 'sox')


kcura and cubs BETWEEN sox
([FIELD VALUE] >= 'kcura and cubs') AND ([FIELD VALUE] <= 'sox')



* If you attempt to use more than one BETWEEN operator in a single filter string (for example, 12/13/2000 BETWEEN 1/0/2008 BETWEEN 5/4/2009), you will receive an Incorrect Syntax error in the filter box. If you need to search for documents based on multiple BETWEEN operators, you can create a saved search with multiple conditions, each of which uses a date field with a between operator and a date range value.
