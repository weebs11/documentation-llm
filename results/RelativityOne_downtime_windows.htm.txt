All time frames and dates are subject to change at Relativity's sole discretion. Relativity will endeavor to provide reasonable notice of changes, except in emergencies. 
Planned release cadence
We will include the most notable capabilities coming each month into one release email that is sent to our RelativityOne administrators, so you can prepare for the changes ahead of time. 
We'll also share a roundup of some of the key enhancements we've released in the previous month. To stay up-to-date on the latest and greatest of what’s shipped in RelativityOne, please visit our What’s New page or review your What’s New notifications in-app.

** Every Saturday that is not an extended downtime window. See Extended downtime windows.
Note: Your specific tenant environment downtime may not last for the full 2 hour window. Actual downtime will be communicated via system notification emails that are sent when downtime begins and when downtime ends for your specific environment.
Extended downtime windows
RelativityOne has extended downtime, typically on a monthly basis, to perform updates and/or version release upgrades.  Exact dates and times are listed below.  All other Saturdays would be the regular maintenance downtime windows listed in Regular maintenance downtime windows. 
The typical downtime window for updates is 8 hours.

Downtime windows are defined as scheduled time that the RelativityOne system will not be available for all or some portions of the RelativityOne system.  Some sub-systems or specific items may still be updating after the downtime is complete.  Some examples of the updates continuing post upgrade would be things such as individual workspaces being updated, files being updated, and other individual items that continue updating or refreshing while the system is operational.
Your specific tenant environment downtime may not last for the full 8 hour window. Actual downtime will be communicated via system notification emails that are sent when downtime begins and when downtime ends for your specific environment.  Only individuals that are a designated RelativityOne contact within the Relativity team’s system will get notifications.

Sandbox environment extended downtime windows
The RelativityOne Sandbox has extended downtime windows during which release updates are performed. See the RelativityOne Sandbox topic on the RelativityOne Platform site  for more information on Sandboxes and their planned schedules.
Requesting to skip a downtime window
Deadline for submitting requests to Relativity
Requests for skipping regular maintenance or upgrade downtime must be received the Tuesday evening before the scheduled downtime by written request to Relativity Customer Success Management or Support. Exceptions to this deadline may be made under extenuating circumstances, but each request will be considered separately and must go through the proper channels for approval.
Note: Relativity will respond by Wednesday mid-day. Final approval or disapproval for skipping downtime will occur by Thursday evening. 
Considerations for skipping a regular maintenance downtime window

For skipped regular maintenance downtime, Relativity will add on an additional 2 hours to the following Saturday’s scheduled regular maintenance downtime (to apply the skipped maintenance fixes, in addition to the current scheduled maintenance/update items).
Relativity does not support skipping more than 1 downtime window consecutively, and will require the following weeks’ extended downtime to apply the skipped updates.

Considerations for postponing an extended downtime window

Relativity cannot support a full skip of an update, but you can request to postpone your extended downtime to the following region's extended downtime window.  For example, if you are a US customer and want to skip your extended downtime, the “following region” is the UK update extended downtime window two weeks later.Exception: If there is not another region extended downtime window within a 3-week time period, Relativity will suggest alternative days/times for the update to be completed.
Relativity only supports postponing an extended downtime window to another region's extended downtime window once per update.
