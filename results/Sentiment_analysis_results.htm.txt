Sentiment Analysis Workflows and Fields Overview


Adding results to the document view
To view results from the main document list, add sentiment analysis columns to your document view.
The following general sentiment columns are available:


Sentiment—the name of the sentiment analysis job that contained the document.


Sentiment::Status—status of the analysis on this document. The possible values are:


Completed—the document has been analyzed.


Error—an error has occurred. For troubleshooting information, see Troubleshooting sentiment analysis errors.


Partial Error—an error occurred when analyzing the document for one or more sentiments, but the rest succeeded.


Skipped—the document is too large to analyze or has no extracted text.


(Blank)—the document has not yet been analyzed.




Sentiment::Overview—shows primary sentiments contained in the document.


Sentiment::Distribution—scores the intensity of each sentiment in the document on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most intense.


Sentiment::Richness—the number of sentences with any predicted sentiment, divided by the total number of sentences in the document.
Note: If a sentence is predicted to have two or more sentiments, it will be counted multiple times towards the overall richness calculation. This can cause the Sentiment::Richness score to be greater than 100.


These sentiment-specific columns are also available for each sentiment that has been analyzed:


Sentiment::[Sentiment] Top Sentences—the top 25 sentences in the document that are predicted to have this sentiment, ranked by confidence score.


Sentiment::[Sentiment] %—the number of sentences predicted to have this sentiment, divided by the total number of sentences in the document.


Sentiment::[Sentiment] Top Score—the confidence score of the sentence most strongly predicted to have this sentiment. This is scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 being the strongest.


For more information on adding columns to a view, see Editing view information.
Filtering and sorting results
You can use the sentiment fields to quickly sort through results and find documents with the strongest or weakest sentiment predictions:


To filter for a specific sentiment, filter the Sentiment::Distribution field to select the sentiments and intensity levels you want to view. For example, to view only documents with strong anger predictions, check the boxes for Anger - 5 and Anger - 4.


To sort documents in order of a sentiment's prediction strength, sort on the Sentiment::[Sentiment] % field for that sentiment.

Troubleshooting sentiment analysis errors
When running sentiment analysis, a few types of errors are possible. These can affect either the entire job or individual documents.
Job-level errors
If the job status is marked as Error, this may be caused by:


Technical issues—connection issues or other technical difficulties prevented the job from finishing. Check your connection and try again.


All documents skipped—all documents in the job were skipped due to their contents. Check that the document set contains English text in the Extracted Text field and try again. For more information, see Document-level errors.


Document-level errors
Document-level errors fall into a few categories:

Error—an error has occurred that prevented processing the whole document.

Partial Error—an error occurred when analyzing the document for one or more sentiments, but the rest succeeded.


Skipped—the document was skipped for one of these reasons:


Too large to analyze—the extracted text field is over 5MB.


No extracted text—the extracted text field has no contents.




For Skipped documents, consider removing the document from the saved search or transferring other text, such as OCR text, to the Extracted Text field. For all other errors, check your connection and try again.
