Understanding the ADS app and OAuth2 client
The mobile ADS app is installed during the installation. The mobile ADS app in Relativity is the connection that creates the unified experience between a web instance of RelativityOne and RelativityOne's mobile app. For more information on using application deployment systems, see Relativity applications. 
When the mobile ADS app is installed, the OAuth2 client is also added to Relativity. Locate the Mobile OAuth2 client  in the OAuth2 Client tab at the instance level. This client authorizes the connection between your web instance and RelativityOne's mobile app. When accessing RelativityOne's mobile app, the OAuth2 client confirms authentication. When the authentication is confirmed, the user is logged in. This is process occurs on every login. For more information, see OAuth2 clients. 
Note: Do not modify the mobile OAuth2 client.
