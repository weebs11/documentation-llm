To pull in all of your desired processing data, use the Field Catalog to map your document fields to Relativity's processing data.

System fields versus optional fields
When mapping processing fields, you will encounter Relativity system fields and optional fields. The following describes the differences between the two field types and how you might work with them.

Relativity system fields refer to Relativity-specific fields that are automatically mapped and published by Relativity. Some examples include the Container ID, Custodian, and Extracted Text. You cannot modify Relativity system fields, and you will not see them in the Field Catalog.
Optional file fields include fields not considered a Relativity system field and vary from file to file. There are two types of optional file fields:File system metadata that comprises a file's properties, such as the file name, file size, date created, and file type.Application metadata stored inside the file itself, such as the author, message heading, and comments. You can only access this data if you have the ability to open the file and extract the content.

Sometimes, you will see a field stored in both Relativity system fields and optional fields, such as Date Created. In this case, Relativity determines which field to keep and which to ignore.

Mapping fields
To map processing fields, perform the following steps:

Open the Fields tab.
Click New Field or Edit on an existing field.
Provide a name in the Name field. We recommend that you give the field an identical name to the one you are mapping to.
In the Object Type field, select Document. Only Relativity document fields are eligible to map to a value in the Source field. Selecting any other object type disables the Source field.
In the Field Type field, select the type of field to set what type of data can be entered into the field.
When the Field Type is selected, you will see the menu for Field Settings and Advanced Settings appear. Click  the Advanced Settings tab. 

Click Select on the Source field to display the processing fields to which the Relativity field can be mapped.
From the available processing fields, select the one to which you want to map, and click Set.
Confirm that the field you just mapped appears in the Source field, complete the remaining required fields and click Save.

Note: If the Processing application is not installed, you can still map fields as long as you have added the worker manager server to the resource pool. 
Relativity system field considerations
Note the following regarding Relativity system fields:

Relativity system fields are mapped by default and cannot be modified. 
Relativity system fields are not listed in the Field Catalog.

A word on Field Catalog source fields

While processing data in an instance, Relativity discovers metadata fields and records them as source fields in the Field Catalog. You can map source fields in the Document object, where the field is then populated when a document is published. 
Note: This occurs instance-wide. If one workspace processes a field with a unique metadata name, all other workspaces will see the source field as available for mapping, even if the workspace has never, and possibly will never, process a file with the same field name.
Example

Workspace 1 - processes a file with a unique metadata name, UniqueData. The field becomes part of the Field Catalog and is available to all other workspaces in the instance.
Workspace 2 - sees UniqueData in the Field Catalog, even though Workspace 2 has never processed a file with the metadata name.


Field mapping validations
When mapping fields, you will receive an error if:


You attempt to map fields of mismatching types. For example, if you map a whole number field in Processing to a Relativity date field, you will receive an error upon saving the field.

You attempt to map a fixed-length text field to a catalog field of a longer length. 
You do not have Edit permissions for the Field object. This is because mapping through the Source field is considered an edit to a field. If you only have Add permissions for the Field object and not Edit, and you attempt to map a field, you will receive an error stating, “Error saving field mapping."

System-mapped fields
The following system-created metadata fields are always populated when data is processed. These fields are automatically mapped and are not available for manual mapping through the Source field on the Field layout: 








Processing Field Name
Source view

A numeric field that offsets how header dates and times appear in the viewer for processed emails. This field will be populated with the UTC offset value of the time zone chosen in the processing profile. For example, documents processed to Central Standard Time (CST), would be populated with a value of "-6" because CST is UTC-6. For more details on this field, see Relativity Native Time Zone Offset.

Virtual Path

						Other Fields
Long Text

Optional fields
The following, optional, metadata fields can be mapped through the Field Catalog. The Field Catalog contains a list of all available fields to map regardless of discovered data.
If you are setting up Processing prior to Discovery and Publish, you have the following options available in the Source field modal:
		Standard Fields—contains a collection of fields from both the Metadata Fields and Other Fields options.Metadata Fields—contains fields extracted from the actual file or file system.Other Fields—contains static, or Relativity system fields such as control number, processing set name, custodian, and so forth.
Please note: 

You can map one processing field to multiple Document object fields.
You can only map a processing field to a Unicode-enabled field. 
The following metadata fields can be mapped to similar field types in the Field Catalog. To map different field types outside of the 135 metadata fields to one another, select All Fields from the drop-down menu in the Source field modal. 
Consider the following data compatible field types with valid mapping:You can map long text document fields to fixed-length text processing fields. However, Relativity does not support mapping fixed-length text document fields to long text processing fields.You can map single choice Catalog fields to destination fields of fixed-length text, long text, choice, or single object fields.  You can map a DateTime field to a Date field if the source field is DateTime and the type of destination field is Date.

Caution: Use caution when mapping to multiple-choice fields. Mapping multiple-choice fields creates a unique value for each choice option. Depending on the multiple-choice fields mapped, you could have hundreds of unique choices, impacting performance.

Sort Date/Time

						Standard Fields
Date

For parent documents, the field is populated with the Primary Date/Time value. For child documents, the field is populated with the Sort Date/Time of the parent document. All documents in a family will therefore have the same Sort Date/Time value, keeping family members together when sorting on this field.
Note: When you filter for dates, you are filtering specifically on the Sort Date/Time field, which is taken from the file's Sent Date, Received Date, and Last Modified Date fields in that order of precedence. This happens on email messages repeated for the parent document and all child items to allow for date sorting.
You have the following options for applying a date range filter:
Note: When processing documents without an actual date, Relativity provides a null value for the following fields: Created Date, Created Date/Time, Created Time, Last Accessed Date, Last Accessed Date/Time, Last Accessed Time, Last Modified Date, Last Modified Date/Time, Last Modified Time, and Primary Date/Time. The null value is excluded and not represented in the filtered list.

						Standard Fields
Long Text

The folder structure and path to the file from the original location identified during processing. For emails, this displays the subject rather than the email's entry ID. This provides you with better context of the origin of the email. 
Previously, the Virtual Path field displayed the entry ID with the email file name, and if you followed this virtual path, it was difficult to tell by that entry ID where the email came from. See Source path for more information.

						Standard Fields
Long Text
The full SMTP value for the   recipient of an email message, for example, “bob@example.com.”
Michael.Capellas@COMPAQ.com


TrackChanges

						Standard Fields
Yes/No

The yes/no indicator of whether the track changes metadata on an Office document is set to True. This does not necessarily indicate if tracked changes were made to the document or not.

On Word documents, the track changes toggle may have been set to True, changes made to the document, then set back to False. In this situation, this field will still indicate ‘No’ because it is looking only at the setting and not for the actual existence of changes even though tracked changes still exist in the document.
If the same situation is applied to Excel documents, the result is slightly different. Microsoft deletes tracked changes on Excel documents when the toggle is set back to False. The returned value will also indicate ‘No’ but there is no concern about missed tracked changes as none exist.
For file types that cannot contain tracked changes, such as PDFs, email, and images, this field is blank.


Yes


Track Changes

						Standard Fields
Yes/No

The yes/no indicator of whether the track changes toggle is set to True and/or there are tracked changes in the document. 
This field maps to the TrackedChangesCombined Invariant field. This will be Yes if either of the following are true:


The Track Changes button is enabled in the document.




There is actual Tracked Change content in the document.



 


Unified Title
Standard Fields
Long Text
The subject of the file. For emails, this is the subject line. For non-emails, this is the file name.Note that in short message (RSMF) conversion, Relativity may use the conversation name as the subject, and therefore the Unified Title.
Company Memo


Unprocessable

						Standard Fields
Yes/No

The yes/no value indicating if a file was able to be processed. If the file could not be processed, this field is set to Yes. 

Even if a file is flagged as Unprocessable, it may still be visible in the native file viewer if Oracle is able to render the file.
The Unprocessable field is set to Yes on any file for which Relativity does not have an Invariant plugin that is capable of extracting text or imaging/OCRing that document type. For example, it is not set for a corrupt file for which we cannot extract text, such as a corrupt Word document that logs an error during data extraction. 
Unprocessable documents do not have errors associated with them because they never reach a point at which they can register a processing error.


No




Note: You can track which passwords successfully decrypted published documents by mapping the Password field found in the All Fields view. Specifically, you can find this Password field by clicking Source on the field layout, selecting the All Fields view, and locating the source field name of Password with a field type of Long Text.
Email Store Name field
To better understanding how the Email Store Name field works, consider the following examples:

When an email comes from .pst file, the .pst is listed in the Email Store Name field. When a child Word document comes from a .rar archive and is attached to the email, the Email Store Name field is blank for the Word document.The RAR/ZIP information for the Word documents mentioned above is found in the Container Name field.
In the following example, email 00011 comes from a .pst file named PSTContainingEmbeddedPSTInFolders.pst, which is the value for the Email Store Name field for that email. The other emails, 00011.001 and 00011.002, come from a .pst file attached to the 00011 email. This .PST file is named PSTWithEmails.pst. In this case, the Email Store Name field for those child messages is PSTWithEmails.pst, not the top-level .pst file named PSTContainingEmbeddedPSTInFolders.pst.




For an email taken from a zip folder, the Email Store Name field is blank.



Virtual path
The virtual path is the complete folder structure and path from the original folder or file chosen for processing to the file. This path includes any containers that the file may be in and, in the case of attached or embedded items, includes the file name of the parent document.  
This path does not include the name of the file itself.  If a file is selected for import instead of a folder, the virtual path for that file is blank. 




The following are examples of virtual paths created from the folders, per the above images:

\Maude Lebowski\Loose Docs
\Walter Sobchak\Walter.pst\Inbox\Unimportant\Fest Junk\Walter
test.pst\My Test Box 	In the case of a container or loose file being directly selected for processing, the virtual path does not have a leading backslash.
test.pst\My Test Box\000000009B90A00DCC4229468A243C71810F71BC24002000.MSG
Revisions.doc	This is the virtual path of a file embedded in the Revisions.doc file.

Processing folder path
The processing folder path is the folder structure created in the folder browser of the Documents tab. Relativity creates this path by keeping any folders or container names in the virtual path and discarding any file names that a file may be attached to or embedded in. 
Files without a virtual path and items embedded within them do not have a processing folder path. If a container is embedded in a loose file, the items in that container have a processing folder path that matches the name of the container. 
The following are examples of virtual paths and corresponding processing folder paths.





Virtual Path
Processing Folder Path




test.pst\Inbox

test.pst\Inbox



test.pst\Inbox\000000009B90A00DCC4229468A243C71810F71BC24002000.MSG

test.pst\Inbox




test.pst\Inbox\000000009B90A00DCC4229468A243C71810F71BC24002000.MSG\Pics.zip


test.pst\Inbox\Pics.zip




Email folder path
The email folder path is the folder path within the email container file in which an email was stored. All attachments to emails have no value for this field. 
For example, an email stored in the Escalations folder in the following image below would have a value of “Inbox\Tickets\Escalations."



Source path
The source path is a modified display of the virtual path. In the case of attachments to emails, any entry IDs of emails appearing in the virtual path are replaced by the subject of that email instead. In all other cases the source path value is identical to the virtual path. 
For example, an attachment to an email could have the following virtual path and source path values:





Virtual Path
Source Path




Sample.pst\Inbox\000000009B90A00DCC4229468A243C71810F71BC24002000.MSG


Sample.pst\Inbox\Requested February reports




Note: This source path field is not to be confused with the Source Path field found on the Processing Data Source layout on the saved processing set.
Message ID considerations
Note the following details regarding the Message ID field:

Message ID is an identifier applied to an email by the program that created the email, such as Outlook, Eudora, or another.   
Email programs can use whatever they want for a message ID, or they can leave it off entirely.  The mail server is free to assign an identifier even if an email client did not.  
There is no guarantee that every message ID is unique because every email client and mail server uses a different algorithm to create one.
Message ID is unique only in the fact Relativity does not know what tool generated the identifier or what algorithm generated it. In addition, Relativity cannot assume that the identifier will even exist in an email.
Relativity cannot validate the message ID because it is made up of opaque data associated with an email.
It is possible that two entirely different emails might share the same message ID.
Using the Message ID is not a reliable alternative to SHA256 de-duplication. For the purposes of de-duplication, we recommend that you use the Processing Duplicate Hash.  If you processed the information in another tool, it is recommended that you use the Hash Algorithm you selected in that tool.

Comments considerations
There are two kinds of comments that are possible in all Office documents: metadata and inline. The following table breaks down which optional processing fields are populated by each type of comment.







Comment type
Location in file
Hidden Data value
Comments value




Metadata
Details tab of the Properties window (when you right-click on file name)
Null (blank)
Contents of comments property on the file


Inline
 In the body of the document
"Yes"
Null (blank)


Both
Details tab of file and body of document
"Yes"
Contents of comments property on the file



Note: There are a number of reasons why a document could contain hidden text. A returned value of Yes for the Hidden Data field doesn’t automatically mean that the document has inline comments.
De-duped custodian and path considerations
If you run de-duplication as part of your processing job, you may want to know where the documents that eventually get de-duplicated came from, the path, as well as which custodian those documents were associated with.
The DeDuped Custodians and DeDuped Paths optional fields allow you to track this information. When a document is de-duplicated, these fields are populated upon publish, or republish.

DeDuped Custodians—a multiple object field with object type Document and associated object type Entity. You should only associate this field with the Entity object. If this field is associated with any other object type, you will not be able to publish documents to your workspace.
DeDuped Paths—a long text document field that provides the location of the de-duplicated document.

To use these fields, simply add them to a document view and refer to that view after your publish job has completed. You can then export the results to an Excel file, if necessary.



Note: When Relativity populates the Deduped Custodians and Deduped Paths fields during republish, it performs an overlay. Because of this, if you modify a document's identifier field in Relativity, your information could become out of sync. For this reason, we recommend that you do not modify the identifier field.
