Placeholders 
You can create your own unique placeholders for productions using images or custom text. Once you create the placeholders, you can attach the placeholders to the production data source. You can also produce the same document in multiple productions with different placeholders. The Placeholder library automatically includes a default image placeholder. If you need to attach a placeholder to a production data source, see Production data source . 
Note: When creating a template workspace using production, Relativity automatically copies Placeholders.

The field name inserts into your custom placeholder, but when you kick off the production, the field name dynamically updates per document. For example, [ControlNumber] updates with the control number field for the document the placeholder corresponds to. Custom type placeholders support document fields using the field name surrounded by brackets: [Document Field Name]. To include a square bracket in the plain text of the placeholder, escape it with a backslash: \[bracketed phrase\].Note: You can only use the date, decimal, fixed-length text, whole number, yes/no, single and multiple choice fields as a token for your placeholder. You must have permissions to the document fields to use them as a token for your placeholder.
