Enhancement
ARM
Lanceleaf RelativityOne
Because there are duplicated documents, there are 3 rows in File table (this is perfectly fine) pointing on the same file due to the fact that ARM during Move job uses ""Move"" method, the 2nd and the 3rd time ARM cannot find the file because it is already moved. Still update path method, does the path update (and file name update) in case of linked files always to file guid name. (that's why if original linked file was not guid named, it will be moved and renamed). (renaming linked files in case of changing them to repository files which mean copy them into repository is desired behavior because e.g. there can be already a file in repository with exactly same name, and the it would be overwritten or skipped, or cause error) There is also a mismatch in call to methods, so ARM creates batches not including processing files.

ADS
Foxglove Early Access
The MaxConcurrentWorkspaceUpgradesPerApplicationInstallerAgent instance setting has been removed. It was originally added to allow concurrent application installs within a single Application Installation Manager agent. We were hoping for less contention in the database by retrieving more workspaces per query and a speed improvement by running the installs concurrently. Since then we were able to reduce blocking in the query significantly, and we have found that multiple threads in an agent are no better than simply adding more agents. There was no longer a need for this capability. Without this setting, the recommended way for a Relativity administrator to speed up application installs is to add more Application Installation Manager agents.
