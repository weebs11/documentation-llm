Saved search history
On the History tab, you can view the audit records for saved searches, unsaved searches, and queries performed on views (such as filtering on a column).
Use the following guidelines to view search history records:

Saved Searches - the Name column displays the name of the search, and the Object Type column displays "Search." Click the Query link to display a pop-up window with the SQL statement for the query.
Unsaved Searches or Views - the Name column displays the name of the view in which the search was performed. The Object Type column displays View. Click the name link to display the details page for the view. You can also click the Query link to display a pop-up window with the SQL statement for the query.
