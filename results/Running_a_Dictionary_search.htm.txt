Running a dictionary search
When you run a dtSearch, you can use Dictionary Search to query the index for a term and find the total occurrences and number of documents in which it occurs. The Dictionary Search dialog displays  the results, including the following columns:

Keyword - the word contained in the index. If you use fuzziness or stemming in your search, this column displays any variations of the term.
Total Words - the number of times the word appears in the dtSearch index.
Total Documents - the number of documents in the index that contain the word.

A dictionary search returns only the first 2,000 items in the result set. If your search returns more than that,  a message displays to indicate that only 2,000 items were returned.
